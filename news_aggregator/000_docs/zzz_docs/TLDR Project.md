TL;DR System - Detailed Breakdown
Core Purpose and System Overview
The TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) system serves as an intelligent summarization engine that processes news articles from multiple sources to create concise, fact-focused summaries. Unlike traditional summarization tools, this system specifically focuses on cross-source comparison and fact extraction, ensuring that users receive the most crucial information while highlighting different perspectives from various news outlets.
Content Processing Mechanism
Initial Content Analysis
The system begins by analyzing articles covering the same news story from the top 5 news sources. Each article undergoes deep linguistic analysis to identify key components such as main events, primary actors, critical quotes, and essential facts. During this phase, the system employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the context and importance of each piece of information.
Key Word Identification and Weighting
The system implements a sophisticated word importance algorithm that goes beyond simple frequency counting. It identifies words and phrases that appear prominently across multiple sources, with special attention to:
The placement of words within articles (headlines, first paragraphs, conclusions) The context in which words appear (quotes from key figures, statistical data, event descriptions) The relationship between words and identified entities (people, organizations, locations)
This weighting mechanism helps determine which elements are truly crucial to the story versus what might be editorial or supplementary content.
Summary Generation Process
Cross-Source Fact Extraction
The system analyzes how facts are presented across different sources, identifying:
Common narrative elements that appear consistently across sources Variations in how different sources present the same information Unique perspectives or additional context provided by specific sources
This cross-referencing helps establish a reliability score for each piece of information and ensures that the final summary includes verified facts rather than speculation or opinion.
Twitter-Style Summary Creation
The system generates concise, Twitter-like summaries that capture the essence of the news story. These summaries are structured to:
Lead with the most impactful and verified information Include numerical data or statistics when relevant Highlight any significant disagreements between sources Maintain readability while maximizing information density
Differential Analysis
A key feature of the system is its ability to identify and highlight differences in reporting across sources. This includes:
Variations in emphasis placed on different aspects of the story Differences in factual claims or numerical data Contrasting interpretations of events or statements
Integration with Knowledge Graph
The TL;DR system doesn't operate in isolation but is deeply integrated with the platform's knowledge graph. This integration allows for:
Contextual enrichment of summaries with related historical events Identification of connections to ongoing news stories Enhancement of summaries with relevant entity relationships
User Interface and Presentation
The presentation layer of the TL;DR system is designed to provide maximum value with minimal cognitive load. Users can:
View the base summary for immediate understanding Expand to see source-specific variations Access the full articles for deeper reading Explore related summaries through knowledge graph connections
Quality Assurance and Verification
The system maintains high accuracy through:
Continuous cross-referencing of facts across sources Verification against trusted reference sources Regular updating as new information becomes available User feedback integration for improvement
The TL;DR system essentially acts as a smart news curator, providing users with verified, concise information while maintaining the complexity and nuance of the original reporting. It saves users significant time while ensuring they don't miss crucial details or important perspectives on the news.
Knowledge Graph Visualization - Detailed Breakdown
Core Purpose and Architecture

Development to Production Pipeline
Phase 1: Local Development
1.	Development Environment 
o	Vue.js application with Vite
o	Local serverless function testing using Vercel CLI
o	Environment variables for different stages
2.	API Development 
typescript
Copy
// api/news/getTldr.ts
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { articleId } = req.query
  // Connect to Oracle backend
  // Process and return data
}
Phase 2: Feature Implementation

o	TL;DR View Implementation
o	Knowledge Graph Visualization
o	Social Media Feed
o	Video Analysis Component
2.	API Integration 
o	Each component gets its dedicated API endpoints
o	Serverless functions handle data fetching and processing
o	Caching implementation where appropriate
Phase 3: Testing and Staging

o	Points to production backend
o	Zero-downtime deployments
Vercel Serverless Functions Strategy
Data Fetching Layer
typescript
Copy
// api/news/getTldr.ts
import { connectToNeo4j, connectToPostgres } from '../lib/db'

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    const data = await fetchNewsData(req.query)
    const graph = await fetchGraphData(req.query)
    return res.status(200).json({
      tldr: data,
      relations: graph
    })
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json({ error: error.message })
  }
}
Caching Strategy
•	Implement caching at edge locations
•	Use Vercel's Edge Cache
•	Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern
Error Handling
•	Consistent error response format
•	Proper status codes
•	Error tracking integration
Scaling Considerations
Vercel's Built-in Scaling
•	Automatic scaling of serverless functions
•	Global CDN distribution
•	Edge caching and computation
Performance Optimization
1.	Image Optimization 
o	Use Vercel's Image Optimization
o	Automatic WebP conversion
o	Responsive images
2.	Code Splitting 
o	Route-based code splitting
o	Component lazy loading
o	Dynamic imports for heavy features
3.	Edge Functions 
o	Use edge functions for global performance
o	Implement region-based routing
o	Cache API responses at edge
