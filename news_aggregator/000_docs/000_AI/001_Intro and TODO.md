Here is direcotry structure of my python data engineering project for fetching and scrapping RSS and HTML pages of categories and articles of 20 most popular portals and doing content analysis upon them:
/home/opc/news_dagster-etl/news_aggregator

Ive just upgraded significantly schema :
news_dagster-etl/news_aggregator/db_scripts/schemas/create_schemas.sql
which holds full db schema that I would like to recreate in my databases for developement and production. 
They are empty currently:


/home/opc/news_dagster-etl/news_aggregator/db_scripts
- here is everything related to Databases and how to control and recreate databases. 
Please inspect it.

Ive also did:

Phase 1: Set up Database Migrations with Alembic
Goal: Initialize Alembic for database migrations to manage schema changes effectively.
Steps:
Step 1.1: Install Alembic: Add Alembic as a project dependency.
We will use execute_command in ACT mode to run pip install alembic.
Step 1.2: Initialize Alembic: Create the Alembic environment.
We will use execute_command in ACT mode to run alembic init alembic. This will create an alembic directory with necessary files.
Step 1.3: Configure Alembic: Configure Alembic to connect to the database.
We need to modify the alembic.ini file.
First, we'll need to read the contents of alembic.ini and db_utils.py in ACT mode to understand how database configurations are loaded.
Then, we will update alembic.ini to use the database connection settings from db_utils.load_db_config(). We will likely need to set the sqlalchemy.url in alembic.ini to dynamically use the configuration loaded by db_utils.py.
Step 1.4: Create Initial Migration: Generate a migration script to represent the current database schema.
We will use execute_command in ACT mode to run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema". This will create the first migration script in alembic/versions/.

I need you now to in :
/home/opc/news_dagster-etl/news_aggregator/config/database
create document that will explain how to upgrade database version with alembic. 
Make it short with commands to be comprehensive so I know how to do db versioning in the future. 


Phase 2: Implement Generic CRUD Functions
Goal: Create reusable generic CRUD functions in a new module.
Steps:
Step 2.1: Create generic_db_crud.py: Create a new Python file in the db_scripts directory to store generic CRUD functions.
We will use write_to_file in ACT mode to create db_scripts/generic_db_crud.py.
Step 2.2: Implement Generic CRUD Functions: Write the following functions in generic_db_crud.py:
generic_create(conn, table_name, data): For INSERT operations.
generic_read(conn, table_name, condition=None, columns='*', order_by=None, limit=None): For SELECT operations.
generic_update(conn, table_name, data, condition): For UPDATE operations.
generic_delete(conn, table_name, condition): For DELETE operations.
These functions will use parameterized SQL and handle basic database interactions.
We will use write_to_file in ACT mode to write the content of generic_db_crud.py with these functions.


Phase 3: Refactor Existing CRUD Scripts and Models
Goal: Refactor existing scripts to use generic CRUD functions and ensure models are up-to-date.
Steps:
Step 3.1: Refactor Existing CRUD Scripts: Modify the existing scripts in db_scripts (e.g., create_portal.py, read_category.py, etc.):
Import functions from generic_db_crud.py.
Replace direct SQL queries for basic CRUD operations with calls to the generic functions.
Keep any table-specific logic within these scripts.
We will use replace_in_file in ACT mode to modify these scripts.
Step 3.2: Review and Update Model Files: Check portal_model.py, category_model.py, etc., to ensure they accurately represent the database tables. Add or modify attributes as needed.
We will use read_file and replace_in_file in ACT mode to review and update model files.


Phase 4: Testing
Goal: Ensure the implemented changes are working correctly and reliably.
Steps:
Step 4.1: Write Unit Tests for Generic CRUD Functions: Create unit tests for generic_db_crud.py to test each function in isolation.
We will need to create a test file (e.g., test_generic_crud.py in a tests directory if it exists, or directly in db_scripts).
Use write_to_file in ACT mode to create the test script.
We will need to use execute_command in ACT mode to run the tests (e.g., using pytest if it's a testing framework used in the project).
Step 4.2: Integration Testing: Test the integration of generic functions with existing parts of the application. This might involve:
Running existing Dagster jobs that use database interactions.
Creating new Dagster jobs or test scripts to specifically test the refactored CRUD operations in the context of the application.
We need more information about the project's testing setup to define concrete steps here.
Phase 5: Cleanup and Documentation

Goal: Finalize implementation and update documentation.
Steps:
Step 5.1: Remove Redundant Scripts: Delete individual CRUD scripts for entities where we decide to fully rely on generic functions.
We will use execute_command with rm in ACT mode to delete files if necessary.
Step 5.2: Update Documentation: Update info.md or other relevant documentation to describe the new hybrid CRUD approach, database migrations, and how to use generic functions.
We will use replace_in_file in ACT mode to update documentation files.
Pre-requisites (Before Starting):

Backup Database: Crucially, before we start Phase 1, please ensure you have a backup of your database. Database migrations and schema changes can be risky, and a backup is essential for recovery if anything goes wrong.
Confirm Database Access: Make sure you have the necessary database credentials and access to perform migrations and testing.
Development Environment: Ensure your development environment is set up with Python, PostgreSQL, Alembic (after Step 1.1), and any testing frameworks.
Important Notes:

We will proceed phase by phase and step by step. After each step involving tool usage, we will wait for your confirmation and feedback before moving to the next step.
This is a comprehensive plan. Depending on the complexity of your existing scripts and the level of testing required, it might take several iterations to complete.
Let me know if you have any questions or modifications to this plan before we begin.

Suggestions for Improvements and Design Pattern Considerations:

Repository Pattern:  While DataAdapter classes are similar to DAOs, they more closely align with the Repository pattern.  Consider explicitly renaming DataAdapter to Repository and the concrete classes to PortalRepository, ArticleRepository, etc. The Repository pattern is a well-established pattern for abstracting data access logic and is very suitable for this project.

Dependency Injection: You are already using a form of dependency injection by passing the database connection (conn) to the DataAdapter constructors. This is good for decoupling and testability. You could consider injecting the DatabaseContext object itself or a factory for creating connections if you want to further abstract the connection management.

Table Naming Strategy:  In CategoryDataAdapter and ArticleDataAdapter, you are using f-strings to dynamically construct table names using portal_prefix. While functional, this approach can become less manageable as the project grows. Consider a more robust table naming strategy:

Configuration-based mapping: Store table names in a configuration file (e.g., YAML) and load them based on the portal_prefix.
Naming convention: Establish a clear naming convention for tables based on portal prefixes and consistently apply it.
Error Handling and Logging:  While basic error handling is present, consider enhancing it:

Custom Exceptions: Define custom exception classes for database-related errors (e.g., DatabaseConnectionError, RecordNotFoundError, DataIntegrityError). This would allow for more specific error handling and reporting.
Consistent Logging: Implement logging throughout the DataAdapters and db_utils.py to track database operations, queries executed, errors, and potentially performance metrics. This will be invaluable for debugging and monitoring.
Unit of Work (Optional, for future consideration): For more complex operations that might involve transactions across multiple repositories, consider implementing a Unit of Work pattern. This pattern helps manage transactions and ensures data consistency when multiple database operations need to be treated as a single atomic unit. This might be an advanced step for now, but it's worth keeping in mind as the project evolves.

In summary, the current structure is well-organized and incorporates several good practices. By focusing on explicitly adopting the Repository pattern, refining the table naming strategy, and enhancing error handling and logging, you can further improve the design and maintainability of your data access layer.

Would you like to proceed with implementing any of these suggested improvements? If so, please let me know which areas you'd like to focus on first, and we can move to ACT mode to make specific changes.
